Custom_Winform By Arsium

This custom winform is all what I needed when I want to make user-friendly and beautiful interface in order to avoid Xaml , WPF or whatever you want. I will add more controls later like custom tabpage ,  button , ...

Currently :


* -Added Custom Rounded Border and custom radius
* -Added Custom Border Color + 
* -Added MouseOver and MouseOut Custom Color
* -Added Draggable Property for ALL form (you can drag and drop whereever you want)
* -Added Title | TextForm as new property , don't use me.text , use this : Me.FormText = ""


Note : 
* -when you use Custom Rounded Border , set formborderstyle to none
* -when you use Custom Rounded Border ,  don't use Colored border and vice-versa , there are conflicts with this 2 properties | this is beta
