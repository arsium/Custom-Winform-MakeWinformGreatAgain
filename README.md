Custom_Winform By Arsium

This custom winform is all what I needed when I want to make user-friendly and beautiful interface in order to avoid Xaml , WPF or whatever you want. I will add more controls later like custom tabpage ,  button , ...

Update 03-05-2020 : 

* -[BETA]Added Hexagon Property to Custom Form (do not use with Rounded Border)
* -Corrected Some bugs with Rounded Borders and ColorBorders (do not use the 2 in same time)

* -Added Custom Button  :  rounded border + radius , gradient property (bottom to top , top to bottom , left to right , right to left)  , mouseover color property , mouseleave color property

* -Added Custom Panel : draggable property ,  rounded border + radius , gradient property (bottom to top , top to bottom , left to right , right to left) 

* -Improved Animations

* -[BETA]Custom tabpages


Updated 27-04-2020 : 

* -Added Container (inhertits panel , you can't delete it)
* -Removed Painted Border thickness (because it creates misalignements actually)
* -Corrected : Misalignements with borders and rounded radius + property not working
* -Added [BETA] animations : FadeIn , FadeOut , Shake , Horizontal Slide and vertical Slide

Known bugs | misalignement : rounded borders with painted borders : right border is smaller than left border


Update 26-04-2020 :

* -Added Refresh event to see the application of properties changed without closing form and re-open
* -Added ColoredBorder Property (same for main rectangle actually)
* -Added Font Color
* -Minors Bugs corrected

Currently :

* -Added Custom Rounded Border and custom radius
* -Added Painted Border (custom color not already done) + thickness
* -Added MouseOver and MouseOut Custom Color
* -Added Draggable Property for ALL form (you can drag and drop whereever you want)
* -Added Title | TextForm as new property , don't use me.text , use this : Me.FormText = ""


Note : 
* -when you use Custom Rounded Border , set formborderstyle to none
* -when you use Custom Rounded Border , don't use Colored border and vice-versa , there are conflicts with this 2 properties | this is beta
* -it will be often updated
* -I can't make dropshadow , just don't ask for this too complicated shit
* -This is just zone color , so if you but any controls like button , it will hide the border
