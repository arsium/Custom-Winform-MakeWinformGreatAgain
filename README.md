Custom_Winform By Arsium

This custom winform is all what I needed when I want to make user-friendly and beautiful interface in order to avoid Xaml , WPF or whatever you want. I will add more controls later like custom tabpage ,  button , ... => will build DLL

* If you want to use it , just add Custom_Winform in your Project !

Update 26-04-2020 : 

* -Added Refresh event to see the application of properties changed without closing form and re-open
* -Added ColoredBorder Property (same for main rectangle actually)
* -Added Font Color
* -Minors Bugs corrected

Currently :


* -Added Custom Rounded Border and custom radius
* -Added Painted Border  (custom color not already done) + thickness
* -Added MouseOver and MouseOut Custom Color
* -Added Draggable Property for ALL form (you can drag and drop whereever you want)
* -Added Title | TextForm as new property , don't use me.text , use this : Me.FormText = ""


Note : 
* -when you use Custom Rounded Border , set formborderstyle to none
