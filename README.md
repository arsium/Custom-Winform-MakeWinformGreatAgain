Custom_Winform By Arsium

This custom winform is all what I needed when I want to make user-friendly and beautiful interface in order to avoid Xaml , WPF or whatever you want. I will add more controls later like custom tabpage ,  button , ...

Updated 27-04-2020

* -Added Container
* -Removed Painted Border thickness (because it creates misalignements actually)
* -Corrected : Misalignements with borders and rounded radius + property not working
* -Added [BETA] animations : FadeIn , FadeOut , Shake , Horizontal Slide and vertical Slide


Update 26-04-2020 :

-Added Refresh event to see the application of properties changed without closing form and re-open
-Added ColoredBorder Property (same for main rectangle actually)
-Added Font Color
-Minors Bugs corrected

Currently :

-Added Custom Rounded Border and custom radius
-Added Painted Border (custom color not already done) + thickness
-Added MouseOver and MouseOut Custom Color
-Added Draggable Property for ALL form (you can drag and drop whereever you want)
-Added Title | TextForm as new property , don't use me.text , use this : Me.FormText = ""


Note : 
* -when you use Custom Rounded Border , set formborderstyle to none
* -when you use Custom Rounded Border ,  don't use Colored border and vice-versa , there are conflicts with this 2 properties | this is beta
